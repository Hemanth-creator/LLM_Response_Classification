# LLM_Response_Classification
A deep learning project to classify responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) into different categories using text preprocessing, tokenization, and a custom neural network built with TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project focuses on building an efficient classification model for LLM-generated text responses. It uses pre-trained tokenizers, fine-tunes embeddings, and trains a lightweight neural network on labeled data to predict response categories.

# ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# âœ¨ Features
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Fine-tuned deep learning model
- Label encoding for multi-class classification
- Training and evaluation pipelines
- Easy-to-extend for new datasets or different LLM responses
